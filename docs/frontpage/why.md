At NTA we have the need for functionality that allows us to apply Kubernetes objects to many clusters and still honoring RBAC. We have many different affiliations working in our clusters and we want them to use it safely without having to care if other affiliations can modify their environments.

* many clusters
* access control, role based RBAC
* composable
* sane defaults
* corporate standard
* external provisioning
* affiliation concept. A team owning multiple namespacees. Group Namespaces
