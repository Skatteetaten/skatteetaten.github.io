## How do we deploy

We started out using [OpenShift Templates](https://docs.openshift.org/latest/dev_guide/templates.html) in 2015. A go-template based template engine that takes a list of parameters and replaces it into objects before applying them to the cluster. For our needs this technology was and is severly lacking. - no support for conditional logic - no support for loops - no support for optionaly including and entire object We then created a bash wrapper around the templates that would generate objects for it and modify them afterwards. The config for this bash wrapper resided along side the application code. After som experience with this we found several issues with it - writing good bash is hard and testing tools are lacking - no client-server model, so we had to duplicate functionality in web dashboard - you had to commit and change code in repo to change config. That means triggereing new jenkins builds when not really needed. This lead to the design of the start of the AuroraAPI with the [boober](aurorapi/boober), [AuroraConfig](auroraConfig) and [ao](tools/ao) components.
