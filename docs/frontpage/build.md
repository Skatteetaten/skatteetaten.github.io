## How do we build

* [PaaS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_as_a_service) built upon [OpenShift](http://www.openshift.com)
* At the core of the plattform is the declerative config format [AuroraConfig](auroraConfig) and the AuroraAPI.
* The AuroraAPI supports deploying applications and observing their status while running.
* Building applications from source is done in the AuroraPipeline that uses a central build logic.
